CanFlasherBLT is a ready-made firmware for a low-cost [Olimexino STM32F3](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/STM32/OLIMEXINO-STM32F3/) board. Once flashed onto the board, you can use this board instead of a conventional (and more expensive) USB-CAN PC adapter, for performing firmware updates on CAN nodes, running the OpenBLT bootloader.
